              "xxbos i have watched this episode more often than any other xxup xxunk episode , it is that enjoyable . xxmaj and it is quite scary , but all in good , xxunk fun . a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a xxunk xxmaj santa xxmaj claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment . xxmaj mary xxmaj xxunk , who i seem to remember from xxup snl or some other xxup tv comedy skit show , is the evil wife , and xxmaj larry xxmaj drake plays the lunatic in the xxunk xxmaj santa outfit . i had forgotten xxmaj santa was played by xxmaj drake over the years . xxmaj his xxmaj santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times . xxmaj you can probably guess how xxmaj santa finally gets into the house . xxmaj the episode is played for laughs , but it also can be pretty intense at times .,xxbos xxmaj as many reviewers here have noted , the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story . i have never seen the stage version of the story , and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj richard xxmaj attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film , but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer xxmaj michael xxmaj douglas ' show . xxmaj the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try - out group . xxmaj this way our attention is focused on the dancers ' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try - outs . xxmaj douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part . xxmaj apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one , and the xxunk cliché - ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added . i have to say in all xxunk this was the weakest part of the film . xxmaj the repeated xxunk xxmaj xxunk made during try - outs appear to mirror the almost desperate xxunk one often has to make when engaging in the artistic xxunk in the absence of talent and / or luck . xxmaj however , this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past , and it 's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its xxunk up once again . xxmaj the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the \" i can do that \" number , but then it xxunk a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories . xxmaj frankly , their stories xxunk little from real life folks who never get a chance like this . * * * of 4 stars .,xxbos xxmaj at first , this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a xxunk the first time i saw it . xxmaj it was like a bad dream . a cosmic bore . xxmaj but i gave it a second chance , then another and another , etc ... i finally got addicted to this film , due to it 's dreamlike slow pace , wonderful natural sets , bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score , which is made of some 70 's xxunk rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter xxmaj derek xxmaj xxunk xxunk should notice the song about hazel wood , silver xxunk and lady vanishing in the air ... xxunk in the middle and near the end of the film . xxmaj there are some xxunk scenes in the beginning , xxunk allow us to appreciate the natural charms of xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj if that movie had been made by some \" repertoire \" directors like xxmaj bergman , xxmaj lars xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj jean - xxmaj luc xxmaj xxunk , critics would have rolled on the floor , xxunk about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece . i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of xxmaj fellini 's cinematic sh # xxunk not for the pretentious .,xxbos xxmaj was this based on a comic - book ? a video - game ? a drawing by a 3 year - old ? \n",

              "xxbos i have watched this episode more often than any other xxup xxunk episode , it is that enjoyable . xxmaj and it is quite scary , but all in good , xxunk fun . a woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a xxunk xxmaj santa xxmaj claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment . xxmaj mary xxmaj xxunk , who i seem to remember from xxup snl or some other xxup tv comedy skit show , is the evil wife , and xxmaj larry xxmaj drake plays the lunatic in the xxunk xxmaj santa outfit . i had forgotten xxmaj santa was played by xxmaj drake over the years . xxmaj his xxmaj santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times . xxmaj you can probably guess how xxmaj santa finally gets into the house . xxmaj the episode is played for laughs , but it also can be pretty intense at times .,xxbos xxmaj as many reviewers here have noted , the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story . i have never seen the stage version of the story , and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj richard xxmaj attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film , but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer xxmaj michael xxmaj douglas ' show . xxmaj the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try - out group . xxmaj this way our attention is focused on the dancers ' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try - outs . xxmaj douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part . xxmaj apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one , and the xxunk cliché - ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added . i have to say in all xxunk this was the weakest part of the film . xxmaj the repeated xxunk xxmaj xxunk made during try - outs appear to mirror the almost desperate xxunk one often has to make when engaging in the artistic xxunk in the absence of talent and / or luck . xxmaj however , this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past , and it 's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its xxunk up once again . xxmaj the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the \" i can do that \" number , but then it xxunk a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories . xxmaj frankly , their stories xxunk little from real life folks who never get a chance like this . * * * of 4 stars .,xxbos xxmaj at first , this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a xxunk the first time i saw it . xxmaj it was like a bad dream . a cosmic bore . xxmaj but i gave it a second chance , then another and another , etc ... i finally got addicted to this film , due to it 's dreamlike slow pace , wonderful natural sets , bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score , which is made of some 70 's xxunk rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor / singer / songwriter xxmaj derek xxmaj xxunk xxunk should notice the song about hazel wood , silver xxunk and lady vanishing in the air ... xxunk in the middle and near the end of the film . xxmaj there are some xxunk scenes in the beginning , xxunk allow us to appreciate the natural charms of xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj if that movie had been made by some \" repertoire \" directors like xxmaj bergman , xxmaj lars xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj jean - xxmaj luc xxmaj xxunk , critics would have rolled on the floor , xxunk about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece . i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of xxmaj fellini 's cinematic sh # xxunk not for the pretentious .,xxbos xxmaj was this based on a comic - book ? a video - game ? a drawing by a 3 year - old ? \n",
